# cassius-labs

This repository is a collection of **hands-on engineering examples** used in my technical articles.

Each folder is tied to a specific Medium post (or series) and contains the complete, runnable code and supporting artifacts referenced in the text. The goal is to keep the articles focused and readable, while offering a reliable place where readers can explore the full implementation.

## What you'll find here

Examples may include:

- Go, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, Buf-based projects
- Multi-language samples when an article requires it
- Architecture artifacts such as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Scripts, configs, diagrams, or other supporting material

## How the repository is organized

Projects are grouped by article or series.  
A typical structure looks like this:

```
series-or-article-name/
  article-1/
    ...
  article-2/
    ...
  adrs/
    ...
```

Each folder should be self-contained and include any instructions needed to run the example.

## Related articles
